# preact-htm-test

This application has been created to try [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) in "HTM mode" using vanilla CSS and JavaScript.

Instead of using JSX, components are rendered using standard tagged templates.

---

The application is running at https://simon-robertson.github.io/preact-htm-test/
